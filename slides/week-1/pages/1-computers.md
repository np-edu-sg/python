* **In the early days, computers weren't as fancy as they are today.**
  * There was no graphical user interface, such as the browser you're viewing this in!
* **To use a computer, you had to type in commands.**
  * These were all text commands, and you had to memorize them!
* **This is known as a text/terminal user interface (TUI)**
  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface>
* The program that runs these commands is known as a _shell_.

# Graphical user interfaces

<v-clicks>

* **With advances in technology, computers become more powerful.**
  * Nowadays, computers all have a graphical user interface (GUI).
* **Most of the times, code is written in a GUI editor.**
  * The editor is also commonly referred to as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
* **However, most programs are still TUI programs.**
  * They run in a terminal, and primarily use text as the input and output.

**In this course, we will be writing TUI programs using Python!**
